# flyer
old SMD marketing flyer
<br> This business is closed but the great swoops of red across the top and bottom catch the attention so I thought it might be worth a look for a portfolio item.  The first thing which catches my eye now is the graphics with bare edges, no border or frame or shadow or blend.  Of course styles go in and out of fashion over the years .. the priority at the time was fitting a ton of information into a one-page flyer and trying to make it look good without being too busy
